        <h4>External Contingencies</h4>

        <h4>No Messaging/Communication Liability for Third-Party Service Providers</h4>
        <p>Although a Telegram-based interface is provided for data labelling tasks, Alaya AI is not responsible for Telegram's operation, downtime, or updates. Alaya AI is not responsible for any losses incurred due to incorrect, fraudulent, or misleading communication or information resulting from errors or vulnerabilities of the Telegram app itself or any other third-party communications or service platforms. Users access Alaya AI through third-party platforms at their own risk.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>8. Data Usage, Model Training, and Data Ownership</h3>
        
        <h4>Ownership of User Data</h4>
        <p>Users retain ownership rights of any original Data submitted to the Platform. Alaya AI does not claim ownership over User-submitted Data. Original Data does not include data labels, segmentation brackets, tracking identifiers, or any other form of processing or manipulation activity applied to existing datasets for the purpose of the Platform's services.</p>
        
        <h4>Licence Grant</h4>
        <p>By submitting Data or provide labelling services, you grant Alaya AI a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, and sublicensable licence to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute such Data for improving AI models, research, or development of additional features.</p>
        
        <h4>Model Training</h4>
        <p>Alaya AI may train or refine AI models using submitted Data. Where feasible, Alaya AI will employ anonymisation or pseudonymisation procedures to protect personal privacy by default.</p>
        
        <h4>Use of Models</h4>
        <p>AI models trained on Data from the Platform may be offered to third parties on a commercial or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) basis. Any personally identifying information is removed to the extent reasonably possible before such usage.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>9. Digital Assets, NFTs, and Utility Token ($AGT)</h3>
        
        <h4>Nature of $AGT</h4>
        <p>$AGT is a strictly utility-based ecosystem token intended to facilitate certain Platform activities (e.g., NFT upgrades, Platform governance). It does not grant ownership, profit-sharing, or any right analogous to company shares or securities.</p>
        
        <h4>NFTs</h4>
        <ul class="indented-list">
          <li>Non-Fungible Tokens on the Platform may represent unique user attributes, achievements, or in-game functionalities. NFTs may be identified and processed as a part of Alaya AI's optimisation algorithm to enhance data task distribution efficiency. NFTs may be airdropped to qualifying Users under special circumstances such as promotional or community events.</li>
          <li>Soul-Bound NFTs are permanently linked to a specific wallet address and cannot be transferred. Soul-Bound NFTs may be identified and processed as a part of Alaya AI's optimisation algorithm to enhance data task distribution efficiency and may be required for Users to access certain tasks.</li>
          <li>NFTs may be upgraded or consumed in conjunction with $AGT or other resources, such as in-game experience points. Alaya AI makes no representations about the future value or utility of such NFTs.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Third-Party Services</h4>
        <p>Users engaging in NFT or token transactions on external marketplaces or third-party services assume sole responsibility for those activities, including compliance with local regulations.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>10. Incentives and Rewards</h3>
        
        <h4>Reward Distribution</h4>
        <p>Rewards (including $AGT) are determined by task complexity, difficulty, required expertise, and data quality. Task Rewards may be calculated and distributed with up to a one-day delay to enable internal algorithmic evaluation of data input quality and Reward amount. Alaya AI may amend Reward structures at any time with reasonable notice to Users in accordance with the best interests of the Platform and its Users or through governance voting.</p>
        
        <h4>Quality Control</h4>
        <p>Task Rewards are only distributed for valid data input. Invalid data input is not rewarded, and continuous or deliberate input of invalid data by Users, whether intentional or not, may be flagged for review. Alaya AI employs optimisation algorithms and data validation procedures to assess the accuracy and integrity of submitted work, and where necessary, may involve human intervention for manual validation of expert data tasks. Alaya AI may restrict access of Users deemed to be acting maliciously on the Platform, such as engagement in spamming or deliberate Data contamination.</p>
        
        <h4>No Guarantee of Income</h4>
        <p>The Platform does not guarantee any specific level of earnings nor guarantee expectations of income sustenance through the use of its services. Rewards are offered for completed tasks but are subject to factors such as data quality, data complexity, and the fair market price for data labelling services in general.</p>
        
        <h4>Transaction and Gas Fees</h4>
        <p>Users are responsible for any blockchain transaction fees (e.g., gas fees) incurred when withdrawing or transferring Rewards from the Platform to their own wallets. Alaya AI may offer limited assistance or compensation for gas fees through task Rewards at its sole discretion, but is not obligated to do so.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>11. Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
        
        <h4>Platform IP</h4>
        <p>Alaya AI retains all rights, title, and interest in its proprietary technology, branding, algorithms, and documentation. Unauthorised use is strictly prohibited.</p>
        
        <h4>Third-Party Contributions</h4>
        <p>The Platform may incorporate third-party software or open-source components, each subject to its respective licence terms. Users must comply with such terms when using the Platform.</p>
        
        <h4>Breach by Malicious Actors</h4>
        <p>Alaya AI is not liable for intellectual property infringements arising from hacking, data theft, or other malicious acts by third parties beyond its reasonable control. Alaya AI will undertake commercially reasonable steps to notify affected parties and mitigate such incidents.</p>
      </div>
